# Arvato Project

This Project was created using Bootstrap, React and Google map API. I used npm package
react-google-autocomplete which helps us to give Google MAP API object and
we used that and started autocomplete the Address whenever user type something.

The Google Map API was used to display the address by taking the place_id from Google
Object.
Example Link is given below:
[Click to view](https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDR3E0Ko3uYrfQaqX9964woDyJ8NoDn4tg).

I have created a data variable in which we input our submitted form data Schema
and displayed it after the Address has been placed according to the requirement in this project.

## Libraries

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [React](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Bootstrap cdn](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css)

## Features

- Uses the Google Maps set of APIs to help users enter their physical address. Provides autocomplete suggestions from Google, and also shows a map when the use selects one.

- A manual form (with fields for Street, Zip code, City, Country) is provided as a fallback.

- A submit form that displays "Form has been submitted"

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Videos

I had a look at some resources available on youtube. Below is a link

The page is responsive and works on different screens.
-iPad Pro, iPad, iPad Mini and on all mobile screens.

## Deployment

-The website was deployed to the branch master on Github.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
